# SiamFC-PyTorch
Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks for Object Tracking

## Overview
This is 
I do this project for learning SiamFC and PyTorch. And the project is being perfected.

## Track
All code is in the direcotry Track.

## Train
All code is in the direcotry Train.

## Performance
### OTB
### VOT
### GOT-10K

## Dependencies
Install PyTorch, opencv-python and GOT-10k toolkit:
> pip install torch opencv-python got10k
[GOT-10k](https://github.com/got-10k/toolkit) toolkit is a visual tracking toolkit that implements evaluation metrics and tracking pipelines for 7 popular tracking datasets.
